```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
```

## Importing the Data


```{r cars, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}


ds_course_data <- read_csv("Data//Data - DS C1 Course.csv")



```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
